\ A defining word used in the form:
\     vocabulary cccc  
\ to create a vocabulary definition cccc. Subsequent use of cccc will
\ make it the CONTEXT vocabulary which is searched first by INTERPRET.
\ The sequence "cccc DEFINITIONS" will also make cccc the CURRENT
\ vocabulary into which new definitions are placed.

\ In asforth, cccc will be so chained as to include all definitions
\ of the vocabulary in which cccc is itself defined. All vocabularys
\ ultimately chain to Forth. By convention, vocabulary names are to be
\ declared IMMEDIATE. See VOC-LINK.
